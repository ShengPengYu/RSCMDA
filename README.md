RSCMDA: Prediction of potential miRNA-disease associations based on a robust similarity constraint learning method

#1.Method Description:
With the rapid development of biotechnology and computer technology, increasing studies have shown that the occurrence of many diseases in human body is closely related to the dysfunction of miRNA, and the relationship between them has become a new research hotspot. Exploring disease-related miRNAs information provides a new perspective for understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of diseases. In this study, we proposed a new method based on similarity constrained learning (RSCMDA) to predict the association between miRNA and disease. Considering the problems of noise and incomplete information in current biological datasets, we designed a new framework RSCMDA, which can learn a new disease similarity network and miRNA similarity network based on the existing biological information, and then update the predicted miRNA-disease associations by using robust similarity constraint learning method. Consequently, the AUC scores obtained in the global and local cross-validation of RSCMDA are 0.9465 and 0.8494 respectively, which are superior to the other methods. Besides, the prediction performance of RSCMDA is further confirmed by the case study on lung Neoplasms, because 94% of the top 50 miRNAs infered by the RSCMDA method are confirmed from the existing biological databases or research results. All the results show that RSCMDA is a reliable and effective framework, which can be used as new technology to explore the relationship between miRNA and disease. 

#2.Method Requirements:
(1). The project was developed based on a Matlab 2016B. 
(2). In order to introduce the project documents more clearly, I put all the source code on the front page.
(3). As GitHub has upload capacity limit, I did not upload the third party jar package, only uploaded the core code of the project.

#3. Usage:
To run our method, simply open the "E_PREDICT.m" script in matlab environment.
